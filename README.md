# What is  happening while pressing the power button

When the power button is pressed, the following events take place:
#
1. Mechanical Action:

    1. The __power button__ is a momentary push-button switch. It is a _soft_ one, because it has the same color when computer is on and off. 
    2. Pressing the button mechanically closes the contacts inside the switch, which is normally open when the computer is off. It provides electricity to the main components of computer. 
#
2. Electrical Circuit Closure:

    1. The closure of the switch closes an electrical circuit on the motherboard.
    2. This circuit is connected to a __General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pin__, which is used to detect the power button press, on the __System Management Controller (SNC)__, which is a specialized microcontroller responsible for managing power functions.   
    GPIO pins can be configured as input or output pins. In this case, the pin is configured as an _input_ to detect the state of the power button.    

        GPIO pins are typically configured with a _pull-up resistor_. It ensures that the GPIO pin is held at a _high voltage level (logical 1)_ when the button is not pressed.
    

        When the power button is pressed, it creates a direct electrical connection between the GPIO pin and ground (0V). This connection overrides the pull-up resistor’s voltage, pulling the GPIO pin’s voltage down to ground (0V). The GPIO pin changes to a _low voltage level (logical 0)_, which the System Management Controller (SMC) detects as a signal to initiate the power-up sequence.
#
3. Debouncing:

    Switches can generate noise due to bouncing (rapid on/off states) when they are pressed.
    The circuit includes a debouncing mechanism (for my laptop it is a debouncing circuit within the SMC) to filter out noise and produce a clean signal. 
#
4. SMC/PMU Signal Reception:

    The clean signal, which is typically low voltage one, from the debounced switch indicates to the SMC that the power button has been pressed.
#
5. Power rails:

    The SMC activates __power rails__, which are specific voltage lines that provide power to different components. This involves enabling the __power management integrated circuits (PMICs)__, which manage the distribution and regulation of power across the motherboard, and __voltage regulation modules (VRM)__, which convert and regulate the voltage from the power supply (a battery in this case) to the appropriate levels required by power rails, to provide stable power to the power rails.   
    
    The PMICs distribute power to VRMs, which further regulate the voltage to precise levels required by different components like the CPU, GPU, RAM, GPU and peripheral devices.  

    The main power rails that need to be stabilized are: 
    1. _Vcore (CPU core voltage)_ - supplies power to the CPU cores. 
    2. _Vmem (memory voltage)_ - supplies power to the RAM. 
    3. _PCH voltage (Platform Controller Hub)_ - supplies power to the chipset, which manages data flow between the CPU, RAM and peripheral devices.
    4. _VGPU (GPU Voltage)_ - supplies power to the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).
    5. _3.3V, 5V, and 12V rails_ - supplies power to specific parts of the motherboard and peripheral devices.
#
6. Internal Timers
    
    The SMC includes __internal timers__ that introduce specific delays to ensure that power rails have enough time to stabilize before proceeding.  

    When the power button is pressed, the SMC begins the power-up sequence. It initializes its internal timers to start measuring the required delay intervals.   
    
    __The following steps take place:__
    1. SMC detects the press and starts a debounce timer. After debounce SMC confirms the press and begins the power-up sequence.
    2. SMC activates the first power rail and starts a stabilization timer. The SMC monitors the voltage levels to ensure they are within acceptable ranges before allowing the system to proceed. If stable after delay, it proceeds to the next rail.
    3. SMC activates the second power rail and starts another stabilization timer. This process repeats for each power rail with appropriate delays to ensure stability.
    4. After all power rails are stable, the SMC starts a final timer. Once this timer expires, the SMC generates the Power-on Reset (POR) signal, and the system begins the initialization and boot process.
#
7. Power-on Reset (POR)

    The __POR__ signal is a specific pulse or series of pulses that reset all major components of the system, including the CPU, GPU, RAM, and peripheral devices. The POR signal is distributed via __dedicated reset lines__, which are specific electrical pathways on the motherboard that carry POR signals to the CPU, chipset, memory controller, and other critical components. Each component receives the POR signal and is reset to its initial default settings, becomes ready for initialization.
    
    __Types of Reset Lines:__

    * _Global Reset Line_ - carries the main POR signal generated by the SMC to all components.
    * _Component-Specific Reset Lines_ - carries POR signal to specific critical component to ensure precise control over its initialization.
    
    __The following steps take place:__

    1. The POR signal travels through the global reset line and branches into component-specific reset lines. Each critical component receives the POR signal almost simultaneously for synchronized initialization.

    2. The CPU receives the POR signal, clears its registers and prepares to execute the firmware instructions from the __reset vector__, which is a specific address in RAM. This address points to the __Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)__, which is a firmware that runs while the PC is booted. This is the beginning of the UEFI execution. 

    3. The chipset, which includes the Platform Controller Hub (PCH), also receives the POR signal and begins initializing its interfaces and controllers. Peripheral devices like USB controllers, audio controllers, and network interfaces are reset and start their initialization routines.

    4. The memory controller receives the POR signal and starts the initialization process for the RAM. This includes configuring the memory timings and testing the memory modules, which is mostly done by different read/write operations.

        Configuring the memory timings:
     
        __Serial Presence Detect (SPD)__ is a standardized method by which memory modules communicate their characteristics to the memory controller. Each memory module contains an __EEPROM (Electrically-Erasable-Programmable Read-Only Memory)__ chip, which is a hybrid memory device that combines features of both RAM and ROM, that stores information such as supported timings, voltage, and capacity. The memory controller uses this information to set timing parameters. Then the memory controller configures these timings.

    When all major components are reset to their initial default settings, the UEFI firmware begins its initialization routines.
